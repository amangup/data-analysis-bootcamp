## The data description

In Pittsburgh, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology. We hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters. We conducted our survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.

## Problems

1. How many survey responses are in the table?
2. How many survey responses were gotten online vs in-person?
3. How many survey responses were collected on each day in the duration of the survey?
4. What is the average time taken to complete the survey?
5. How many distinct zip codes were included in the survey?
6. How many people in total have interacted with an Autonomous Vehicle?
7. For each type of response to `FeelingsProvingGround`, count how many people gave that response?
8. Same question as Q7, but only from people who have interacted with an Autonomous Vehicle.
9. For each type of response to `AVSafetyPotential`, count how many people gave that response?
10. Same question as Q9, but only from people who are **Mostly familiar** or **Extremely familiar** with the AV technology (`FamiliarityTechnology` column)
11. How many people are in favor of any type of regulation on Autonomous Vehicles?
