# Installing jupyter notebook

To install the jupyter notebook package, we will use the **Anaconda package manager**. Anaconda is a great utility package that is used to manage the versions of the Python interpreter and the individual packages (like `numpy` and `pandas`). It knows which version of each package is compatible with specific versions of other packages. Essentially, you can use anaconda to install the latest version of each package and never face an issue where two packages conflict with each other.

It's distribution also contains all of the data analysis and data science packages which are frequently used, so most likely one will not have to install other packages for this kind of work.
